## Getting Started

This project is a [_fastlane_](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) plugin. To get started with `fastlane-plugin-ovo_gptdriver`, add it to your project by running:

```bash
fastlane add_plugin ovo_gptdriver
```

## About ovo_gptdriver

The GPT Driver Fastlane Plugin provides a streamlined way to upload build artifacts to the GPT Driver service as part of your CI/CD pipeline. It supports uploading platform-specific binaries (such as APK, AAB, or IPA files), attaching metadata, and associating each build with your organization via a secure key.

This plugin is ideal for mobile teams that want to automate build delivery to GPT Driver with minimal configuration and full control over metadata like branch names or deployment context. Upon successful upload, the action returns the unique build ID generated by the GPT Driver service.

## Available Actions

### ovo_gptdriver_upload_build

This action uploads a build artifact to the GPT Driver service, along with relevant metadata such as platform, organization key, and custom deployment information (e.g., branch name). It is intended for use in CI/CD environments and ensures that each build is properly registered with GPT Driver. If the upload fails, the action returns nil instead of raising an error, allowing for graceful handling.

```ruby
ovo_gptdriver_upload_build(
  build_path: build_path,
  organisation_key: organisation_key,
  platform: platform,
  metadata: metadata
)
```
